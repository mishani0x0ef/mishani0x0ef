### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### âš¡ About me

I'm a professional software engineer **since 2014** with a passion for great products creation, software quality, and mentoring. 

I have worked with various technologies and mainly focused on, but not limited to, .NET and front-end (Angular, React). I like to work in product teams with the ability to fully own the development process (from the first line of code to production deployment), do not really like outstaff.
