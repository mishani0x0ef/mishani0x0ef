## ‚ö° About me

I'm a professional software engineer **since 2014** with a passion for great products creation, software quality, and mentoring. Have experience in solutions creation and dev processes establishment.

I have worked with various technologies and mainly focused on, but not limited to, .NET and front-end (Angular, React).

I like to work in product teams with the ability to fully own the development process (from the first line of code to production deployment), do not really like outstaff.

### Basics

| Category                           | Skills                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patterns, practices and principles | `OOP`, `SOLID`, `GoF`, `TDD`, `MVVM`, `MVC`, `MVP`, `Reactive`, etc. |
| Security                           | `OWASP`, `SSO`, `Auth0`                                              |
| Methodologies                      | `Agile`, `Scrum`, `SAFe` `Kanban`                                    |

> üí° I believe that regardless of the role (back-end or front-end) engineers must know software development basics, be able to choose the correct data structure, follow SOLID and recognize patterns they follow.

### Back-end

| Category             | Skills                                                  |

| Other                | a bit of `Python` with `Flask`                          |

> üí° I strongly believe that API should be easy to use, must have good public documentation (e.g Swagger), and should be easy to build, test, and maintain.
